Nowdays we have seen that political campaigns are placing more emphasis on social media
tools as a low-cost platform for connecting with voters and promoting engagement among
users in their political base. Social media is used by people to share their opinions and
views. The use of the Twitter micro-blogging platform as a tool to predict the outcomes
of social phenomena is a recurrent task in the recent social network analysis literature.
Twitter is an outlet for up-to-the-minute status updates, allowing campaigns, candidates
and citizens to respond in real-time to news and political events. Virtually all candidates
and elected officials have a presence on Twitter and many users rely on Twitter to stay
informed about political events. The content and structure of the political discussion
that takes place on this platform, easily accessible through their API, represents a unique
opportunity for researchers interested in the study of elections and public opinion.
The aim of this study is to predict the political orientation based on Twitter
users’ posts. 

We created a model using FastText, an advanced Natural Language
Processing tool which can be used both for text representation and for text classification.
Then we used some simpler word vectorizer tools: Bag-of-Words and Term
Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency. Their results have been used
as an input for the following Machine Learning classifiers: Linear Support Vector Classifier, Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier, Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier, XGBoost Classifier.
